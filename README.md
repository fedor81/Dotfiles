### My Neovim Code Runner

You can configure the default behavior of code runner in the `.config/nvim/lua/code_runner/` directory

You can create a file called `.nvim_code_runner.sh` in the directory where the editor is opened and specify what actions you want to perform when you launch the code runner.

To run code inside Neovim, use the `<leader>ru` command. This uses the nvchad.term
